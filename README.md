Webster is a simple file organization system I will be using at work and at home. This will hopefully keep me from having a cluttered
virtual desktop and help me get personal with Clojure (one week in, so far so good).

EDIT: This project may not ever be updated again. Just familiarizing myself with Clojure a wee bit. We'll see.
